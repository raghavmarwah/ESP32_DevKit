# ESP32 Development Board Clone

This is project #3 for the course [KiCAD like a Pro] (https://techexplorations.com/so/kicad-like-a-pro-3rd-edition/). In this project I created my own version of the very popular [ESP32 development kit] (https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html) using open source schematics provided by [espressif] (https://www.espressif.com)
